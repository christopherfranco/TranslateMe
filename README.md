# Project 6 - *TranslateMe*

Submitted by: **Christopher Franco**

**TranslateMe** is an app that allows users to translate from a variety of languages. 

Time spent: **27** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users open the app to a TranslationMe home page with a place to enter a word, phrase or sentence, a button to translate, and another field that should initially be empty
- [X] When users tap translate, the word written in the upper field translates in the lower field. The requirement is only that you can translate from one language to another.
- [ ] A history of translations can be stored (in a scroll view in the same screen, or a new screen)
- [ ] The history of translations can be erased
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a variety of choices for the languages
- [ ] Add UI flair

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

The clear history function gave me more trouble than I imagined. Saving the translated text also gave me a bit of
a headache. Firestore was also new to me so it caused a few issues.
