**Who:** The app is targeted at cat owners and/or fans who want to learn more, or to help them with their care.
**Why:** This app is created to help cat owners learn more about their cats, and make taking care of them easier. Searching up a specific breed will return different key aspects, such as social needs, health issues and more.
**Challenges:** Potential challenges include correctly using the API, implementing a database for possible cat profile creation, possibly implementing a reminder system (users can set reminders for feeding, grooming, etc.), and more.

## App Idea 2: HabitHive

**Why:** Building habits can be difficult, and many existing apps are either too simple or too complicated. HabitHive aims to bridge the gap by creating a balance between motivation, simplicity, and fun.

**Challenges:** Potential challenges include taking into account how a person's height, sex, etc. may affect their recommended nutrition goals.

**Who:** The app is targeted for anyone looking to improve their mental well-being, specifically those who want to incorporate mindfulness practices into their daily routine. This could include teens, adults, or even older adults looking for a digital way to journal. 
**Why:** Gratitude journaling has been shown to boost happiness, reduce stress, and improve overall mental health. This app offers a simple, accessible tool to make daily journaling easy and consistent, while also providing users with a place to track their thoughts over time.
**Challenges:** Balancing a minimalist interface with helpful features like tagging, image uploads, or progress tracking without overwhelming users.
